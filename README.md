    /e title:           Your title
    description:        Your description
    url:                The url your title sends you to when you click it
    color:              The hex color code of the embed
    timestamp:          True or False - If you want a timestamp at the bottom of your embed or not
    footer_image:       The url of the image in the footer
    footer:             The footer text
    thumbnail:          The url of the thubmnail image

The title should be enclosed in double quotes and there needs to be a `#` infront of the color code

Here's an example:

description: Embed Description Here
url: https://discordapp.com
color: #788cd4
